# Capstone-Flight-Project
Here in this project we have imported data from the kaggle for flight data analysis. where we have train and test data on which we need
to do some futhure analysis and get the meaningfull insight from it.

 “A Study on Flight Data Analysis”
 
Aim: End to End analysis of the flight data and visualize it to get meaning full insights from it.

Project Outcome: Build the model on  Random Forest, and improved some parameters for better performance of  the model. Visualize the data and got meaningful insights like why and when flight price increases. Along with that performed feature encoding and feature selection on the data to get statistical analysis.We got Rsquare of 82% . Also we created the Auto ml pipeline and save the model in pickle format.
